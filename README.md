# elevation-project
The R code from my undergraduate dissertation (finished in March 2020), examining the effect of elevation on the resistance of freshwater ecosystems in the UK (in my study I looked at drought). 
There are some areas where I had to use Microsoft Excel (don't tell anyone!) and you will have to source your own API key from Google (https://console.developers.google.com/) for the Elevation API. 
It's pretty scrappy as I wasn't planning on making it publishable but I've spent some time trying to make it fairly reproducible. Some of the libraries I called on are not used later in the script because it was when I was experimenting with handling the data. 
As of posting this repository (23/10/2020), I am much more efficient and cleaner at coding in R due to lots of practice.

I'm posting this as a reference for future environmental students and also to show off my work so don't plagiarise me.
